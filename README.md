# Software-Design
Demonstrates my ability to write a software design document for a hypothetical company, The Gaming Room.

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room (TGR) is a company that has hired my company, Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), to help expand the Draw It or Lose It game application, originally for Android systems, to multiple platforms. Draw It or Lose It is a game where teams compete to guess what image is being rendered by the application in real time. 

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
While developing the software design code for The Gaming Room's game application, I kept my audience in mind while writing. Therefore, I was able to explain the software and hardware requirements to the client, TGR, while being clear and concise.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
In the process of writing the software design document, I wrote detailed information about the application's UML class diagram. Describing the diagram helped me understand the relationships between the classes in the code. This, in turn, helped me develop the actual code.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my software design document to revise, I would pick the System Architecture View section. Although the system architecture information is not included in the scope of this course, I am eager to learn about system and subsystem architecture, physical tiers, and logical topology.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by thoroughly contemplating the user's experience on various types of operating systems and platforms. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the reason we are creating this game application. If the game does not run well, whether that means it is slow or nonfunctional, then the user's experience is negative, and they will not continue to use the game application or suggest it to other people. Therefore, I considered how to optimize the system for the game application.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When designing the software, I made sure to read the given code snippets thoroughly in order to understand the logic of the code. Then I read the given in-code comments in order to completely understand what was needed to make the application fully functional. In order to analyze and design a similar software application in the future, I would use many of the same techniques. My coding and design pattern knowledge is accumulating quickly. This will help me write similar code more efficiently in the future.
